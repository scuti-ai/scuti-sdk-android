# Scuti Native Android SDK

Scuti is a monetization platform designed to enhance player experiences with your games. 

Gamers can opt-in to Scuti by visiting the Scuti store. The store is filled with physical products, video trailers, and online offers. They can earn blockchain backed 'Scutis' by making purchases, logging in daily, and watching video ads. These Scutis can then be exchanged for in-game currency or used to making other purchases.

Developers get a cut of all purchases made and videos watched from within their game. They also get 100% of the revenue from any Scutis that are exchanged for their game's native currency.
